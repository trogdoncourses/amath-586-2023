# UW AMATH 586 Spring 2023

On this page you will find homeworks, sample code, usually in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and additional materials and resources.

For assignment discussion and submission we will use:

[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com)

Accompanying each assignment is a link for you to initialize a repository.  The code you write for the assignment should be put there.  It allows you to ask specific questions about specific lines of code and allows me to comment directly on your code.  Also, it's good to get used to `git`. 

Lastly, homeworks will be submitted via gradescope: https://www.gradescope.com/courses/381632

## Homework GitHub links

See Canvas or the homework folder for the assignment and turn in your write-up to Gradescope.
